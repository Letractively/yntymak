3 major problems in an example:
	1) Actually there are 2 actors(user and admin), but there is no information and screenshots about "admin" actor.
	2) Not detailed description about screenshots. There is only one sentence for one screenshot.
	3) Each element(button, input fields, menus, action mechanisms and etc.) of screenshots are not written.
2 main benefits of doing screenshots:
	1) In future it will help us to realize and develope the project easier.
	2) It makes easier and more comfortable to discuss details with customer, when you have ready screenshots of the project.

Three main problems in second example.
1) in registration of the student and employee, there are no preconditions and postconditions. But it is necessary, because 
if the student want to register and there is already exist such name, what should user do?
2) they don't have section 3.5 in this example, so it is a big problem.
3) section 2 is not fully described.
